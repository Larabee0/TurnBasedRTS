It is now internal.\n* Changed visibility of `ColliderGeometry` struct. It is now internal.\n* Changed visibility of `PrimitiveColliderGeometries` struct. It is now internal.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* The relative velocity in the angular velocity motor is now calculated correctly and the relative orientation between the two connected rigid bodies is correctly taken into account. This makes the motor work properly in all configurations.\n* Prevent issues with update order for `ModifyJointLimitsSystem` in netcode multiplayer use case in which the system could not be placed after the `PhysicsSystemGroup` since both were no longer in the same group."
